# Credit Fruad Detection
Credit fraud detection is a critical task in the financial sector, requiring accurate and efficient models to identify fraudulent transactions among large volumes of legitimate ones. **Random Forest** is an ensemble model that constructs multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It captures complex relationships between transaction features and is robust to noisy data, making it a strong baseline for fraud detection. **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** builds trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones. Its regularization and handling of imbalanced data enhance performance, especially in detecting rare fraudulent cases. **LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)** is designed for efficiency and scalability, using histogram-based algorithms and leaf-wise tree growth for faster training and lower memory consumption. It performs exceptionally well on large, high-dimensional datasets typical in credit transactions. Finally, the **Optimized LightGBM** model involves fine-tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate and maximum depth to maximize precision and recall. By optimizing parameters through methods like grid search or Bayesian optimization, it achieves higher detection accuracy and minimizes false negatives. Together, these models represent a progression toward faster, more accurate, and more reliable fraud detection systems.
